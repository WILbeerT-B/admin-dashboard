Project: Admin Dashboard

Intermediate HTML and CSS Course from The Odin Project

Introduction: We are going to build a admin dashboard using Grid for the majority of the layout.

Goal: To build a dashboard and be able to:
1. Practice what we have learned about Grid
2. Familiarize the properties (and shorthand properties) of Grid
3. Try to use Flexbox and Grid together

About: I plan to build this project similar to the design file,
but I will change the fonts and colors.
